# Culinary_Creatives_Chatbot
A Recipe Generation Chatbot

## Introduction
This project utilizes the power of large language models (LLMs) to create a fun and interactive recipe generation chatbot. Inspired by your ingredient choices or dietary needs, the chatbot helps you discover delicious recipe ideas!

## Features
**- User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbot is built using Gradio, providing a simple web interface where you can easily enter your desired ingredients or dietary preferences.

**- Pre-trained Recipe Generation Model:** Leverages the "flax-community/t5-recipe-generation" model, a transformer-based LLM specifically trained on a massive dataset of recipes.

**- Customizable Generation:** Fine-tune the recipe generation process through parameters like maximum recipe length and creativity (temperature).

## How To Use
### 1.Install Dependencies:
-  Install the required libraries (gradio, transformers, and flax) using pip install.

### 2.Run the Project:
- Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., app.py).
- Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run **python app.py** command.

### 3.Interact with the Chatbot:

- The Gradio interface will launch in your web browser, typically at [Recipe Generation] (http://127.0.0.1:7860)
- Enter your desired ingredients, dietary restrictions, or a general recipe theme in the text input field.
- Click the "Submit" button or press Enter.
- The chatbot will use the model to generate a recipe description based on your input.

## Future Work Ideas
**- User Input:** Allow ingredient selection, dietary preference specification, and cuisine choice.

**- Recipe Output:** Provide nutritional information, recipe formatting, and multiple recipe options.

**- Advanced Features:** Integrate image generation, ingredient substitution, and step-by-step instructions.

**- Model Refinement:** Fine-tune the model with additional data, implement feedback mechanisms, and explore other models.

**- Engagement:** Allow saving recipes, social sharing, and building a user feedback community.
